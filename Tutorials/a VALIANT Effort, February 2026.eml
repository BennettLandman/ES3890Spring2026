February 2026

Friends,

It seems only fitting that in the shortest month of the year, we deliver on=
e of our longest newsletters. To paraphrase Taylor Swift, we have a lot goi=
ng on right now.

I have just returned from the SPIE Medical Imaging (https://t.e2ma.net/clic=
k/wiqowm/w6syclcc/ocsv3rb) conference, where an energetic and creative Vand=
erbilt cohort, pictured above, presented more than 50 papers and sessions a=
nd took home honors across image processing, informatics, computer aided di=
agnosis, and AI in medicine. Our awardees included graduate students, medic=
al students, visiting scholars, and undergraduates. Together, they are push=
ing boundaries and asking fundamental questions: What does it mean to learn=
? What does it mean to create? What does it mean to discover as partners wi=
th AI?

Back in Nashville, that same energy continues. I am deeply grateful to Jess=
e Spencer Smith and Alan Karns for guest lecturing in my Studio in AI cours=
e and helping us explore how to integrate AI into meaningful projects. Acro=
ss campus, our scholars are contributing to discoveries that span disciplin=
es, from planetary science to proteomics, from harmonization in brain MRI t=
o translational work in bronchoscopy and beyond, as reflected in this month=
=E2=80=99s Alchemists=E2=80=99 Corner.

At the same time, AI opportunities are accelerating across Nashville and Mi=
ddle Tennessee. Industry partners are spinning out of Vanderbilt and others=
 are joining our circle, eager to translate the ideas and momentum here int=
o real world innovation. I value the early conversations just as much as th=
e fully formed partnerships. Each represents a spark.

This spring, we will amplify that spark through our Discover AI (https://t.=
e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/44sv3rb) event and a new PITCH competition. =
AI Scholars will present three-minute, single-slide visions for transformat=
ive pilot projects, bold resource investments, or boundary-pushing experime=
nts. A distinguished panel of external judges will allocate real funding to=
 the ideas that spark their imagination, serving as entrepreneurial catalys=
ts for innovation=C2=A0in our dynamic research community. Along with live A=
I demonstrations and dedicated networking time, Discover AI will help us dr=
eam boldly and build wisely.

One thing is certain: there is never a boring day at VALIANT. I look forwar=
d to connecting with you this spring, whether electronically, in person, or=
 through carrier pigeon.

Warmly,=C2=A0

Discover AI 2026

VALIANT's Discover AI (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/kxtv3rb)=C2=
=A0on April 24, 2026 will bring our community together for a day of artific=
ial intelligence in action, featuring interactive demos, industry and organ=
izational partners, and an evening reception designed to spark new collabor=
ations. As part of the event, students can compete in both a PITCH competit=
ion and an AI Demo competition for funding and recognition to accelerate th=
eir ideas, and VALIANT Fellows are receiving early access to nominate stude=
nts and labs before applications open university wide. This is an opportuni=
ty to elevate emerging AI research, strengthen interdisciplinary connection=
s, and highlight the innovative work already happening within our center wh=
ile helping the next generation of projects take shape.

Building Tools That Translate

We continue our profile series on the VALIANT community with our most recen=
t member... AI Scholar Yimeng Dou=E2=80=99s career sits at the intersection=
 of hardware, algorithms, and clinical reality.

As an undergraduate at UC Davis, he designed circuit boards and signal comp=
ression strategies to enhance positron emission tomography (PET) imaging sy=
stems. He later helped build PET analysis pipelines and deep learning frame=
works for biomedical applications. Along the way, he co-founded a student s=
tartup aimed at helping adolescents with chronic disease transition into ad=
ult care, learning firsthand that innovation requires both technology and a=
 viable path to impact. During his PhD at Wisconsin, Yimeng advanced multim=
odal medical image registration and freehand 3D ultrasound reconstruction, =
earning recognition in international challenges and publishing in leading v=
enues.

What brought him to MASI is a conviction that data matters. Deep learning i=
n medicine must grapple with real-world variability across devices, institu=
tions, and patient populations. He is particularly intrigued by image-based=
 search across large clinical archives, asking how we might use one image t=
o retrieve similar cases and reduce diagnostic ambiguity.

New to Nashville (joining VALIANT this month), he has already observed that=
 people here are surprisingly friendly. We are delighted that his next chap=
ter, and his next set of big questions, will unfold with us.

Our scientists are breaking new ground:

Dr. Can Luo, who successfully passed her PhD defense on January 21 (https:/=
/t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/0puv3rb), has received the prestigious Ou=
tstanding Doctoral Student Award.=C2=A0=C2=A0She has also accepted a postdo=
ctoral position with Professor Evan Eichler at the University of Washington=
, a world leader in structural variation and population genomics, where she=
 will begin in April. Her research will focus on developing computational m=
ethods for analyzing genome-wide structural variation in large-scale long-r=
ead sequencing datasets, including graph-based variant discovery and collab=
orative studies with major genomics consortia to uncover disease associatio=
ns and population genetic patterns.

DSI's=C2=A0AI Days 2026=C2=A0

AI Days 2026 (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/8nyv3rb) brings Vand=
erbilt=E2=80=99s community together for two days of hands on workshops, res=
earch showcases, and cross disciplinary conversations focused on generative=
 AI and agentic systems. Built around the theme Come with Ideas Leave with =
Solutions, the conference is designed to help participants move beyond insp=
iration and walk away with practical strategies they can immediately apply =
to their academic and scholarly work.

THRIVE-AI=C2=A0

VALIANT is proud to be part of THRIVE-AI (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w=
6syclcc/ogzv3rb), a statewide effort uniting Tennessee institutions to buil=
d interdisciplinary AI and machine learning capacity. Through collaborative=
 workshops and partnerships across Knoxville, Nashville, and Memphis, the i=
nitiative empowers emerging researchers to develop ethical, AI driven solut=
ions that address critical health disparities across the region.

A Deeper Dive into the Brain=E2=80=99s Networked Waters

On March 17 from 1 to 2PM CST, the VALIANT Deeper Dive Seminar Series welco=
mes Weifeng Yu from the University of Virginia for a focused exploration of=
 graph learning in multimodal neuroimaging. His talk,=C2=A0Integrating Mult=
imodal Imaging and Non Imaging Data via Graph Learning, will chart how func=
tional connectivity and behavioral characteristics can be woven together to=
 better differentiate psychiatric disorders, highlighting the role of thala=
mic and network level patterns in adolescent neurodevelopment.

Editor's Choice Award

AI Fellow Kurt Schilling's work on preclinical diffusion MRI was selected a=
s an Editor=E2=80=99s Pick of=C2=A0Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (https://=
t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/48zv3rb), highlighting practical guidance =
for rigorous in vivo small animal imaging. This recognition underscores the=
 growing impact of our collaborative efforts to strengthen standards in tra=
nslational diffusion MRI research.

From Brain Tracts to Beating Hearts

VALIANT and VUIIS investigators Dr. Bennett Landman and Dr. Kurt Schilling =
have received a Leeds=E2=80=93Vanderbilt Pump Priming Seed Grant with Dr. I=
rvin Teh (University of Leeds) for =E2=80=9CAdvancing 3D microstructural ch=
aracterisation in whole heart: From tracts to sheetlets.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 The=
 project will translate connectomics-style diffusion MRI analysis into the =
heart - using whole-heart tractography and tract-/sheetlet-level phenotypin=
g to quantify how cardiomyocyte and sheetlet architecture differs between r=
elaxed vs. contractured hearts, generating pilot data for sustained collabo=
ration.=C2=A0 This work combines Landman=E2=80=99s expertise in large-scale=
 image processing and analysis, Schilling=E2=80=99s expertise in tractograp=
hy/tractometry pipelines, and Teh=E2=80=99s expertise in cardiac diffusion =
MRI, imaging, and anatomy, building on their broader =E2=80=9Ctractography =
beyond the brain=E2=80=9D collaboration.

Keeping in touch

We cut through announcement overload by unifying AI related seminars and vi=
sits into one shared calendar (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/k10=
v3rb) that helps our community discover ideas beyond their home area and sh=
ow up for the conversations that spark the best new thinking.

Deep Thinking, Shared

We were delighted to host Mengqi Wu from the University of North Carolina a=
t Chapel Hill for a VALIANT Deeper Dive seminar on multi site brain MRI har=
monization. His presentation sparked thoughtful technical discussion and ex=
actly the kind of engaged exchange that makes this series so valuable to ou=
r community.

Letting the Students Use AI

Faculty Seminar March 3rd @ 9am (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc/0=
t1v3rb):=C2=A0Should students be allowed to use AI in coursework=E2=80=94an=
d if so, under what conditions? This session explores practical approaches =
to integrating AI into assignments while maintaining academic rigor and int=
egrity. We=E2=80=99ll discuss policy design, transparency expectations, and=
 how to distinguish between productive AI use and overreliance.

Using AI to Improve Student Feedback

Faculty Seminar March 6th, 2026 @ 12pm (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6s=
yclcc/gm2v3rb):=C2=A0AI can generate summaries, draft comments, and even su=
ggest improvements=E2=80=94but how can it meaningfully enhance the feedback=
 process without diminishing instructor voice or student growth? This discu=
ssion focuses on ways AI might streamline grading workflows, improve feedba=
ck quality, and support more timely responses while keeping faculty firmly =
in the loop.

When the Code Works but the Student Didn=E2=80=99t Write It

Faculty Seminar March 18th @ 12pm (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6syclcc=
/we3v3rb). In technical courses, AI can produce fully functioning code in s=
econds. But if the solution works, how do we assess whether the student und=
erstands it? This session examines strategies for evaluating comprehension,=
 reinforcing learning objectives, and redesigning assessments to prioritize=
 reasoning over output.

I Think My Student Used AI to Cheat. What Do I Do?

Faculty Seminar March 24th @ 8:30am (https://t.e2ma.net/click/wiqowm/w6sycl=
cc/c73v3rb).=C2=A0As AI tools become harder to detect and easier to access,=
 faculty are navigating new gray areas around academic integrity. This conv=
ersation addresses how to respond when AI misuse is suspected, the limitati=
ons of detection tools, and how to approach these situations thoughtfully a=
nd consistently.

ere an energetic and creative Vanderbilt cohort, pictured above, presented =
more than 50 papers and sessions and took home honors across image processi=
ng, informatics, computer aided diagnosis, and AI in medicine. Our awardees=
 included graduate students, medical students, visiting scholars, and under=
graduates. Together, they are pushing boundaries and asking fundamental que=
stions: <em>What does it mean to learn? What does it mean to create? What d=
oes it mean to discover as partners with AI?</em><br><br>Back in Nashville,=
 that same energy continues. I am deeply grateful to <strong>Jesse Spencer =
Smith</strong> and <strong>Alan Karns</strong> for guest lecturing in my St=
udio in AI course and helping us explore how to integrate AI into meaningfu=

t span disciplines, from planetary science to proteomics, from harmonizatio=
n in brain MRI to translational work in bronchoscopy and beyond, as reflect=
ed in this month=E2=80=99s <em>Alchemists=E2=80=99 Corner</em>.<br><br>At t=
he same time, AI opportunities are accelerating across Nashville and Middle=
 Tennessee. Industry partners are spinning out of Vanderbilt and others are=
 joining our circle, eager to translate the ideas and momentum here into re=

ity with our most recent member...</em><strong> AI Scholar Yimeng Dou=E2=80=
=99s</strong> career sits at the intersection of hardware, algorithms, and =
clinical reality.<br><br>As an undergraduate at UC Davis, he designed circu=
it boards and signal compression strategies to enhance positron emission to=
mography (PET) imaging systems. He later helped build PET analysis pipeline=
s and deep learning frameworks for biomedical applications. Along the way, =
he co-founded a student startup aimed at helping adolescents with chronic d=
isease transition into adult care, learning firsthand that innovation requi=
res both technology and a viable path to impact. During his PhD at Wisconsi=
n, Yimeng advanced multimodal medical image registration and freehand 3D ul=
trasound reconstruction, earning recognition in international challenges an=
d publishing in leading venues.<br><br>What brought him to MASI is a convic=
tion that data matters. Deep learning in medicine must grapple with real-wo=
rld variability across devices, institutions, and patient populations. He i=
s particularly intrigued by image-based search across large clinical archiv=
es, asking how we might use one image to retrieve similar cases and reduce =
diagnostic ambiguity.<br><br>New to Nashville (joining VALIANT this month),=
 he has already observed that people here are surprisingly friendly. We are=
 delighted that his next chapter, and his next set of big questions, will u=
nfold with us.</span></div>
