**HostB: I think that's what makes this kind of research so compelling. The potential to make a real difference in people's lives.**

**HostA: Absolutely! And it's not just about the tech itself, but also about the people behind it. The researchers, the engineers, the clinicians – they're all working together towards a common goal.**

**HostB: That's a great point. And it's heartening to see VALIANT playing a key role in facilitating this kind of collaboration.**

**HostB: I think what's most interesting here is the way VALIANT is bringing together different disciplines to tackle some of the toughest challenges in medical imaging. It's a great example of how interdisciplinary research can lead to breakthroughs.**

**HostA: Welcome to today's Deeper Dive, I'm excited to be talking to Mengqi Wu about her work on harmonizing brain MRI across institutions without paired data.**

**HostB: That's a fascinating topic, especially given the challenges of multi-site studies in neurodegenerative disease research.**

**HostA: Exactly, and I think it's amazing how Mengqi's work can help unlock large-scale studies while preserving the biological signals that matter most.**

**HostB: That's crucial for understanding complex diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, where having a unified dataset can lead to breakthroughs.**

**HostA: I'm curious, Mengqi, can you walk us through how your methods work and what kind of impact you're hoping to see?**

**HostB: What I'd like to know is, what are the broader implications of this work for the field of neuroimaging and disease research?**

**HostA: Well, if we can harmonize brain MRI across institutions, it opens up so many possibilities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing.**

**HostB: And what about the potential for AI-driven insights in neurodegenerative disease research? How might this work fit into that landscape?**

**HostA: Oh, I think it's a game-changer. By leveraging AI to harmonize MRI data, we can get a much clearer picture of the underlying biology.**

**HostB: That's a great point. I'd love to hear more about how Mengqi's work is being received in the research community.**

**HostA: I'm sure our listeners are eager to hear more about the potential applications and future directions of this research.**

**HostB: Absolutely. Well, Mengqi, thank you for sharing your insights with us today.**

**HostA: The pleasure is mine, thank you for having me!**

**HostB: And to our listeners, I think it's clear that this is a topic worth keeping an eye on.**

**HostB: It's a reminder that our community is not just making incremental progress, but working towards transformative breakthroughs that can improve human lives.**

**HostB: Well, that's all for today. Thanks for tuning in, everyone!**

**HostB: I think what's most striking is the potential impact of this research on addressing some of the world's most pressing scientific grand challenges.**

**HostB: It's a reminder that our community is not just making incremental progress, but working towards transformative breakthroughs that can improve human lives.**
